The program takes marks of multiple students as input.
It first checks whether the marks are valid (0 to 100).
If marks are invalid, it displays an invalid message.
For valid marks, it assigns a grade category like Fail, Average, Good, Very Good, or Excellent.
It also counts the total number of valid students and failed students.
At the end, the program prints the final marks list and the results summary.
